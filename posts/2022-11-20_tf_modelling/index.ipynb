        "Neural Network also known as an Artificial Neural Network, mimics the same architecture of our human brain. It’s the core of any Deep Learning or Machine Learning Algorithm. It consists of three essential factors also called **Nodes or Layers**, that make up the neural network architecture. First, the **Input Layer** is the entry point for any data. After the data passes through the input layer it moves toward multiple **Hidden Layers**, this is where patterns are learned by the neural network using weights and biases. Once the network has reached its mathematical conclusion in the hidden layers it passes to the **Output Layer**.\n",

It is not flexible enough to build a neural network that has shared layers or a non-linear branched topology. Although, sequential models were capable to produce great results. It was not capable enough to solve complex problems like object detection in computer vision, speech-to-text recognition, or vice versa, and many more. Finally, Keras came up with **Functional API**, here everything is isolated and combined however you see fit. A neural network that is now customizable layer-to-layer.\n",

Just the way to represent the model has changed, but this change is powerful enough to build some of the famous pre-trained models(e.g. AlexNet, VGG, ResNet, Densenet, and many more). Let’s understand the changes that are happening in the functional API model.\n",

        "\n",
        "2. Now the fun part starts, we have used 4 hidden layers separated into two different branches. In Functional API, layers communicate by letting them know which layer is connected. If you look at the hidden layer “layer_x1”, at the end of the Dense layer statement it mentions the layer connected i.e. the input layer. This way you can chain any layer with each other and forward pass the model.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. Now that we have created two branches but need the output from a single layer, we can use the concatenate layer. The last layer of the branches is the input for the concatenate layer which is finally connected with the output layer to give us the output probabilities.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. All the layers are connected, so it is time to define the model, for this we will be using the Keras Model function. The Model function needs two Arguments inputs and outputs. It basically tells the start and end point and the flow of the model is created.\n",

By the way, there's a third method that I haven’t mentioned in this article. It's called the [Model subclassing](https://www.tensorflow.org/guide/keras/custom_layers_and_models) method. I do not recommend this for a beginner to begin their journey in deep learning, it is much more complex and difficult to understand however powerful enough to create your own custom layers and models.\n",
